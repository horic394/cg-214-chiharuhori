    <h2>Iceland, a mysterious country</h2>
    <p>Iceland is one of the mysterious countries in the world. I guess it is because "Ice" prevents people from going there. Also Icelandic artist, Bjork globally delivers mysterious atmosphere through her music. Iceland is a tiny but very powerful and interesting country. It's capital city is Reykyavik.</p> &nbsp;

    <p>The national size is quite small but everyone is very creative. I guess this is because dark winter triggered Icelandic people to engage in creative activities. Also unique landscapes such as volcanos and a lot of falls have impact on their aesthetics. In this unique occasion, a lot of young talents are coming up. Asgeir is the latest artist to represent current Icelandic music! Check out his beautiful tunes!</p> &nbsp;
