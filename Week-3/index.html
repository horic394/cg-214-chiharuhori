    <h2>My history of Web</h2>
    <p>I started to play games on computer, when I was a kindergarden kid. In my kindergarden, we had a time to learn how to use computers and my father let me use his one for business. But since then, I wasn't really into it because I preferred to playing the piano all day. On the other hand, my younger sister started coding when she was 4th grade at elementary school, which was probably self learning. Although I was very impressed at how she created her own website, my interests was towards listening to music next.</p> &nbsp;
    <p>At my colledge, a coding class was one of the requirement courses even though my major was Liberal Arts. I was very excited about developing my own website about <a href="pages/iceland.html">Iceland</a>, where I studied for a year, as an assignment. During the days in Iceland, I was supposed to build a practical website about my life in Iceland with my friends but we were interested in traveling European countries more than completing the website.</p> &nbsp;
    <p>One of my best friends inspired me to take a coding class during this summer when I prepared for my portfolio website. He is a web designer in Japan and he advised me to learn coding for a better career. So, here I am!</p> &nbsp; <img src="images/ad.png" alt text="ad medium" title="advertising mediums." />
    <h2>How Important to Learn Web Design!</h2>
    <p>My previous career as a media buyer, specializing in newspaper, at <a href="http://www.asakonet.co.jp/inter/"><i>Asahi advertising agency</i></a>, gave me a strong impression about the necessity in web. Traditional medium such as TV, news paper, radio and magazines have lost their sales as well as the number of subscribers, which are problems to be solved, on the other hand, sales related to web service have incredibly increased. If I become a graphic designer or go back to advertising agency as the same position, web knowledge will help me develop my career a lot. </p>
    <h3>I really <a href="pages/enjoy.html">enjoy</a> learning how to develop web designa in this class!</h3> &nbsp; <img src="images/brackets_logo.png" alt text="Brackets Logo" title="My favorite extention:Beautify" />
    <h2>My Favorite Brackets Extention: <i>Beautify</i></h2>
    <p>My favorite Brackets extention is <i>"Beautify."</i> Beautify is an extention tool to properly indent codes you wrote to find errors. It's very easy. Just download the Beautify extention and select all the part you want to beautify. Then press "Shift+Command+L" all together. I strrugled with the assignment last week because of mistyping. I guess this extention will help me prevent code errors!</p>
