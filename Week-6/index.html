       <p>My midterm project is about "Travel and Bath" because both topics are my favorite things. If I can find a nice bathing place, I like the place more! I have been to 35 countries ever and tried different types of bathing culture. In this project, I'd like to introduce 3 countries and their bathing cultures; Morocco, Iceland and Japan. The reasons I chose these countries are following. Morocco+ I guess many people are unfamiliar with Islamic bathing culture, which is actually very cool. When I tried Moroccan bathing, I danced with other people who were in the same bathing spot and naked! I don't know what it was but totally cool experience I'd like to share. Iceland; When I studied in Iceland as an exchange student from my Japanese university for a year, Icelandic bathing culture prevented me from home sick. Icelandic people enjoy public hot tub under the stars even in the winter. Also, they have hot springs around the country. Hot springs are one of the reasons for foreign travelers to visit Iceland. As well as international trips, I like domestic travels. Therefore, I'd like to share Japanese bathing culture with the class. Especially, I'm going to focus on Dogo hot spring which is very famous bathing area in Shikoku area, which is Western island in Japan. When I went there for summer vacation, I was supposed to spend just 1 night. But I immediately fell in love with the place and ended up spending the entire 5 days only in Dogo although I was planning to travel around the island. I'm going to passionately talk about my travel and bathing cultures in 3 countries I picked up.</p>

        <p>In this project, I'd like to try "Image Map," which is one of new challenges. When users click a specific area on a world map, they can see each country's bathing culture page. Each page will be graphically shown using google map, photos and videos to share excitement of bathing culture with viewers. Also, I would like to try visually organized layout. My blog I have submitted so far looked very old style web page. In this project, I'd like to brush up my CSS skill as well. My entire goal for this project will be that viewers are entertained by contents as well as visual elements.</p>
