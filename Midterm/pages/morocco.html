    <h2>Morocco</h2>
    <h3>Mysterious bathing culture</h3>
   <div class="moroccoContent">
    <div class="morocco1Description">
    <p>When I found <i>Hammam</i> in Marrakech, Morocco, I was really excited because I wanted to take a rest  in the middle of 2-month-trip almost around the world (this trip started from Jamaica and continued to the US, Iceland, Netherland, Spain, Portugal, Morocco and ended in Italy!). Moroccan people have their own bathing places called hammam and I tried touristic hammam which is fancy and local one for my experience.
    </p>

    <p>The fancy spa was only for ladies. I got massage and special treatment. Everywhere in the spa smelled beautiful roses and I felt as if I became a princess! I don't really remember the price but it should be cheap because I was able to pay it even after my belongings were stolen in Spain!</p>
    
    <p>On another day, I tried a local hammam which was cheaper than the previous spa. I remember the security box wasn't safe enough so I felt very anxious while taking a bath.</p>

    <p>There were ladies who took care of visitors. They washed our bodies and gave massage. They had us hold hands with other visitors, make a circle and dance in the bath. I didn't get what it was. But it was really fun!</p>

    <p><b>Morocco</b> is northern west African country. It is very close to Spain, 1 hour by ferry. Because of easy access from Spain, many tourists visit Morocco. There are many attractions such as the old market in Fez, desert tour to South Morocco, and Jemaa el Fna Square market. Good food and cute suveniors.</p>
