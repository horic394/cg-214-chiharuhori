                <p>Travel and hot bath... These two topics are both my favorite things to do. Of course, each topic attracts me a lot, but if they are combined together, it's absolutely amazing! </p>
                <p>Since I studied in Iceland as an exchange student for a year when I was college student, I had many opportunities to travel around European countries because of easy access and cheap flight tickets. I flew to European countries almost every month to get sunlight and experience local cultures which I couldn't get in Iceland. Even after Iceland, I saved up money to continue traveling abroad while studying in Tokyo. Totally, I have been to 35 countries ever and now I live in New York, which is like a long-term trip! I love to expose myself in different cultures which I believe inspire me a lot.</p>
                <p>And, bathing! That's the only thing I really miss about Japan although I love living abroad. My country, Japan has a cool bath culture such as hot springs. Most of Japanese houses have a bath tab and Japanese people believe taking a hot tab contributes to our physical and mental health. I love the moment that I step in to the hot water during cold winter time. I feel it releases my stress and happy about ending the day. (Usually, Japanese people take a hot tab at night.)</p>
                <p>Now you know how much I love traveling and hot tab. Luckily, sometimes I can experience local bathing culture while traveling abroad. I thought bath culture exists only in Japan, or at least sharing it with South Korea which historically has many cultural things in common. However, suprisingly, there are several countries which have unique bathing cultures. When I found this fact, I like to try local bathing experience. Sometimes, I feel scary because we have to do unfamiliar dance as a bathing process in some contries. But overall, those experiences broadened my horizons and made me more familiar with the countries.</p>
                <p>So, I'd like to share my traveling and bathing experience in this blog! I hope you enjoy them and learn something new for your inspiration. </p>
